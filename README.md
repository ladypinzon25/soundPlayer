# REACT CHALLENGE

Sound player: https://codepen.io/felipevega/pen/ZqqBxJ 

This is a **working** HTML5 sound player that has been implemented using HTML / CSS3 / jQuery.
The challenge is to **re-implement it** using **React**.

#### Implemented functionalities

1. Implement the same sound player using React preserving as much as possible the animations and interactions from the original sound player.
2. Replace the hardcoded values (albums, track anmes, track urls) by a request to a server using [axios] using a fake JSON service (https://fakejson.com/)
3. Make the components look great with CSS included flexbox.
