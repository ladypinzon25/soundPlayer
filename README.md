# React Challenge

Welcome to React front-end challenge

This challenge serves to evaluate your level of proficiency in React and your capacity to solve a day-to-day problem.

In this example you will find a **working** HTML5 sound player that has been implemented using HTML / CSS3 / jQuery.
Your job is to **re-implement it** using **React**.

Take a look at the sound player:

https://codepen.io/felipevega/pen/ZqqBxJ

You just need to clone this repo and start working on it.
After you've finish, just send us the link of your repo by email so we can evaluate.

#### TODO

1. Implement the same sound player using React. Try to preserve the animations and interactions from the original sound player.
2. Make the components look great with CSS (BONUS: Show us your skills using [flexbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj7NZ6FiQvo&list=PLu8EoSxDXHP7xj_y6NIAhy0wuCd4uVdid)).
3. Replace the tracks hardcoded values (albums, tracks, etc) by a request to a server using [fetch](https://github.github.io/fetch/) or [react-refetch](https://github.com/heroku/react-refetch). Tip: You may want to use a fake JSON service (https://fakejson.com/)

#### KICK OFF

```sh
npx create-react-app react-sound-player
cd react-sound-player
npm start
